# FS

Run the server with

```bash
yarn
yarn tsc
yarn start
```

The server part of this system is already designed and exposes a set of REST endpoints via the `/api` route and a GraphQL endpoint via the `/graphql` route.

The client has been setup and can be located [here](https://github.com/whitehox/fs-frontend).
